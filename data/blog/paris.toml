    "After staying in a crazy crowded and cramped hostel, a 10 square meter Airbnb was such luxury! I developed so much of an appreciation for everything that I took for granted such as simply having a counter to keep my cosmetics or just having a desk to sit at and plan the day. The bathroom was quite small though.",

    "It's been really interesting to see the differences of city culture in my travels, most noticeable being masking and jaywalking. In Berlin, everyone waited for crossing lights and most wore masks on public transport, whereas in London, I literally saw only one person wearing a mask after walking around for a day and even the elderly were crossing streets and expecting cars to slow down. Most of all, Paris pedestrians seemed to have right of way on the tiny streets rather than cars, a welcome change of pace!",

    "I originally had low expecations for food in Paris, after hearing from my family that they didn't enjoy the food. However, I've already developed a taste for French food both in flavor and in price, so I had a blast! My favorite meal was escargot and beef bourguignon. Beef bourbignon was once upon a time my favorite meal before I largely gave up beef, so I was very pleased to have such a great rendition in Paris. On the other hand, in my opinion, the bakeries and pastries weren't much different than in San Francisco, and I maintain that the best croissant is a fresh out of the oven (or reheated in a steam toaster!) regardless of what bakery made it.",

    "My next destination is Madrid, after some plan reshuffling! I realized I had booked a flight out from Paris Beauvais, which is apparently a 2 hour drive from Paris. Luckily flying between Europe is incredibly cheap, so I was able to find a reasonably priced ticket to Madrid only a couple of days before my flight. My next update will include my thoughts on tapas now that I know to expect small plates!"
