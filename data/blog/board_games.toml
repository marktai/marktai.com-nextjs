    "If you know me, you know I love to play games. Inspired by playing card games with my siblings as a kid, I've grown to appreciate all manner of games between board games, video games, party games, casino games, etc. However, I'll scope this blog post to just discussing board games, with playtime from 5 minutes to 5 hours.",
    "I have a (not) hot take where I believe playing board games should be fun for everyone playing, and that's more important than winning or the quality of the game. Throughout my broad experience of playing games with many different groups of people, I find that some people prioritize winning at all costs over the enjoyment of the group. To counteract this, I believe it's the host's responsibility to both assemble the right group and choose an appropriate board game that is enjoyable for everyone. For a well designed board game, the objective for all the players is to win, but it's both the board game designer and host's responsibility to make sure that playing to win is fun for everyone.",
    "To help you be a great board game host, here are some of my favorite board games I recommend and why. I've broken these down into player counts since often that's the largest deciding factor for choosing games, as splitting into multiple groups is only socially sustainable with 15+ players. The game titles are also colored by complexity:",
