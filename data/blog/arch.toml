	"I've always been a bit of a Linux nut, but never had the courage to delete my lovely Linux Mint installation and to switch over to the mythical Arch.  However, after I accidentally bricked my Mint setup by forcing a shutdown while my VM was running, I decided I wouldn't even try to fix Mint, and instead, I would go wholeheartedly into Arch.  ",
	"After I frantically recovered all of my data from Mint using a recovery USB, I tried to install an Arch ISO onto a USB.  Easy first step right?  What I didn't know was that my antivirus software on Windows didn't play nice with the USB writer software I had.  I somehow fried two of my USB drives, which are now undetectable by Windows.  I resorted to ordering 3 new USB drives from Newegg, but I ended up frying one of the new ones too.  Frustrated, I used the recovery Linux to use dd to simply copy all the bits over to the USB.  With a working Arch image in hand, it was now time for the hard part.  ",
	"I was familiar with the process of installing Linux to dual boot with Windows on different partitions, but Mint gave me a nice GUI that I just pointed and clicked on.  Arch gave me a nice terminal that greeted me with <pre>root@arch-iso</pre>  I slowly learned how to find my disks and partitions through much trial and error, and eventually, I cleaned out my old partitions and mounted them for a fresh new install of Linux.  I figured I had a decent knowledge of Linux and my system, so I casually ignored a few steps.  I gradually came to understand that every word on the Arch wiki is gold and I am not a special snowflake.  ",
	"After researching the dozens of Arch's suggestions on various programs, I ended up using a LDM Cinnamon DE setup.  Cinnamon was what I was familiar with and I really liked it over all of the other desktop environments.  I set up my Nvidia drivers correctly, customized my Cinnamon theme (which uses CSS thankfully), and installed the freshest version of Sublime Text 3 on the market.  Finally, I restarted to see if my Nvidia drivers would offer the hardware acceleration that Cinnamon wanted, and my computer simply didn't boot into Arch anymore.  ",
	"Confused and upset, I tried to google my problems, \"Arch Linux not booting.\"  Sadly enough, this was the most descriptive I could get on my problem, as it didn't even show a terminal anymore.  Fortunately, my problem just happened to pop up as the 4th result on Google.  It turns out that pacman had attempted to update the Linux kernel, but I hadn't set my boot partition to automount.  After updating the Linux kernel once more with my Arch USB, I finally had a beautiful working Arch system.  ",
	"Lessons I've learned from this 8 hour struggle with the machine include: <ol><li>Always fully read the Arch Wiki.  Always.</li><li>Other people are just as bad as me at Linux.</li><li>Struggling through problems actually teaches me a lot about my system.</li></ol>  Can I say that I've actually benefitted from using Arch?  Probably not.  Do I know inside that I'm a better coder for going through this pain?  Again, definitely no.  However, I now have the most bleeding edge software and a slightly slower computer.  Was it worth it?  Totally."
