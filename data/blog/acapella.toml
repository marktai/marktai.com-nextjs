								"I, Mark, love New Orleans jazz, but I haven't been able to play in a New Orleans jazz band in years. So I decided to turn my family into one!",
								
								"I arranged (not composed) <a href='https://www.marktai.com/download/me/music/Miss_New_Orleans_a_capella.pdf'>this 5 part a capella piece</a> for my family, gave brief private + group lessons, and then we recorded this video in our Seattle family vacation when we finally all congregated! It's by no means a perfect performance, but I'm really happy with how each singer has individually improved (most of the family has literally no singing experience), as well as learned to sing together as a group. I'm hoping we can practice more and eventually do a performance for an audience one day!"
