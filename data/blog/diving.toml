                "Diving is my favorite activity I've discovered since starting my funemployment. It combines the best parts of swimming and running, namely the physical motions of swimming as well as being able to look around and discover like running. I've also consistently found that my dive guides (AKA divemasters) are still excited about seeing the fish and sharing the dive experience, as opposed to just being a job for them. I've been having a great time adding diving to my travel itinerary whenever possible, including Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and soon Vancouver!",

                "To really maximize on my newfound enthusiasm before it might wane, I booked a dive cruise through the Socorro Islands, way off of the tip of Baja California, without much research or looking at alternatives. I think this was the most value I've found in a purchase of this price. Typically, diminishing returns on value kicks in, such as fine dining not being 2-10 times as much value as a typical meal. However, this dive cruise included 20 of the best dives I've done in my life, typically priced around $50 to $100 each, as well as comfortable room and great food for 7 days. I'm really looking forward to booking another liveaboard dive cruise, either in Egypt or Indonesia next!",

                "In Socorro, we dived with friendly giant mantas, massive schools of sharks (including hammerheads), curious seals, and even an authentic shipwreck! I personally don't take pictures while diving because it's a lot to think about on top of diving, but here's some pictures that other people have taken of the fish I experienced:",

                "During the dive cruise, I also discovered that I'm still passionate and interested in diving, even after doing four dives a day. The takeaway is that I eventually want to become a divemaster and spend up to three months in another country! I look forward to developing intimate knowledge of dive sites, sharing the dive experience with others, and eventually doing a solo night dive! I'm currently looking for a city where the dives are great, I can practice Spanish, and potentially also become a bartender. Some nice to haves are a local jazz jam session, delicious local food, and being close to the States so friends and family can visit. So far the only place that satisfies all six criteria is Puerta Vallarta, but I intend on exploring dives across all of Mexico to find alternatives before settling down. Hopefully in the next six months, I'll have an update on where to learn diving with me!",

                "I also might update <a href='http://diving.marktai.com'>diving.marktai.com</a>  with curated pictures of my dives if you want to check for new pictures. Hopefully I can dive with you soon!",
