Hello hello!

I'm Mark, and I've just been certified as a [PADI Scuba Diving Instructor](https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver) (don't purchase on this site). My goal is to share my passion for scuba diving with my friends, cheaply! You're at least a little bit interested, so let me explain how this all works.

## Safety is always first
There are a lot of misconceptions about scuba diving that I and others had before learning more. The biggest one for me was not realizing *safety is always first when diving, especially in a course.* Recreational scuba diving should always be safe and is safer than many sports including running. I've been trained to always keep watch on my students and ensure their safety at all times, as well as being trained in emergency first response and rescue. Certified divers can independently avoid all problems by following safety practices that I can easily teach in our courses. 

## You don't swim much
Another major misconception is that you need to be able to swim well to scuba dive. With the aid of fins, being able to breathe freely, and avoiding surface currents, scuba diving is significantly more chill than swimming in the ocean. *With fins and proper kicking, you don't swim much while scuba diving.* Proper scuba diving technique is to be relaxed and swim slowly (agonizingly slowly in my opinion). I've needed to learn to do a weak kick every 5 seconds to set a proper pace when I lead dives. 

## The underwater world is magical
Now that some misconceptions are cleared up, there are so many reasons to love diving. There's the really obvious one that <b>there's so many magical things to look at underwater</b> in an entirely different environment than you're used to. I still vividly remember the whale shark, manta rays, turtles, and seahorses I've seen on my dives. Vibrant, healthy, and massive coral is awe inspiring.

## Weightlessness feels amazing
But there's great parts about diving besides just looking at aquatic life. I personally love the feeling of weightlessness and being able to control my height. *Scuba diving is the closest humans get to the feeling of flying, where you are free to move in any direction.* I also really enjoy the calmness of hearing just your own bubbles and not needing to listen to other people. The ocean is a great break from the heat of tropical islands, though that is a self-inflicted problem. 
   

# Come dive with me!
Hopefully you're convinced to go diving! Normally the open water course costs $300 - $400.  However, I get special discounts and don't take a commission when teaching friends, so I can certify you in 2 - 3 days for significantly less. I'd recommend planning at least 5 days staying in the area though so we can actually do fun dives instead of just doing the course where we need to do a lot of lessons in the water. 

If you're interested, feel free to message me, or email me at <a href="mailto:dive.with@marktai.com" target="_top">dive.with@marktai.com</a>. I love diving, and I hope you will too!
