    "The last planned stop on my Europe trip was Bologna. I picked a variety of both accommodations and destinations, and Bologna was the least concentrated city. This time, I was staying in an \"aparthotel\" with 4 private that shared a common area. I briefly chatted up the various residents that I saw, but it was not nearly as friendly of an atmosphere as the hostel I stayed at previously. ",
    
    "I've begun to understand that I'm not nearly as much or an extrovert as I though I was. I've been perfectly happy to travel by myself without much of an urge to seek social interactions, though by no means am I explicitly avoiding others. I simply read Brandon Sanderson and played chess in various parks to enjoy the day. The Ponte Veccio was my favorite spot in Italy, where I listened to a great Italian jazz trio, soaked up the Arno river vibes, and lost some rating points in chess. ",

    "The social activities I did end up attending tended to be food tours or cooking classes. I've been learning recipes that I will and definitely won't try again at home. The pasta making experience ended up being quite the disaster where I cut the noodles \"papadeli, not tagliatelle,\" neither of which I was familiar with, as well as struggling to make tortellini before the pasta dried out. I will definitely opt to do machine rolled and cut pasta from now if I ever muster up the courage to make pasta from scratch again. I personally also found Italian food to be good, but very simple and not quite to my palette. I prefer my own chicken cacciatore where I include a whole variety of ingredients including mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spinach over the straightforward Bolognese sauce. On a happier note, my favorite dinner was an anchovy Neapolitan pizza and a bottle of a sweeter red wine that paired quite nicely with the salty toppings. ",

    "Here's a tiramisu I spotted on my food tour that looks just like my pizza sour cocktail that I also serve in a tiramisu glass.",

    "Overall, I've been having a great time solo traveling this past month! It's incredibly liberating to be able to whimsically make and change plans without worrying about group cohesion or balancing people's wants. I can easily change my mind on restaurants after seeing the vibes or seeing the an excessive wait, reschedule activities if I feel too rushed, and sleep in the perfect amount of time. The flip side of such a long vacation is that I'm becoming more desensitized to more touristy experiences, but I've also been figuring out what I always enjoy doing, namely exploring food options and walking around the city. I look forward to extended stays in New York, and future solo travels in Asia in February!"
