    "I've been staying in a hostel for the past week, and it's been such a different experience than any of my previous travels before. The first night I fell asleep to a harmony of five people's snores, which somehow was better than just one person snoring. The last night, there was amazingly no snorers and was by far the best night sleep I had. I found a bunch of small life hacks, such as stringing my charger cable through the bunk above me so I wouldn't pull it out at night, and then hanging my glasses on the dangling cable for safe, easy access.",

    "As for actually exploring London, I've been having a good time simply walking around but not overly packing my day with plans and activities. Traveling alone has made small talk with new people much more engagigng as it's now the only conversations I have now. People I've met come from all over the world, and have such more varied experiences than just my homogenous friend group in San Francisco. Some of the more touristy things I've done include a free walking tour of London, local art and culture museums, watching Les Miserables, and eating fish and chips, though my favorite food in London was <a href='https://www.dishoom.com/'>Dishoom</a>.",

    "As far as the solo travels go, I've been just taking the time day by day, allowing space for me to be flexible and have the freedom to do whatever sounds most interesting at the moment. So far, that includes a lot of reading Brandon Sanderson as well as rediscovering a joy of chess, which I haven't competitively played for almost 20 years!",

    "My next destination is Paris! I'll be looking forward to trying French sandwiches, soups, and crepes. Many of my friends and family say they didn't enjoy the food in Paris, and I'm hoping to find places I love to prove them wrong. I'll post another update after I'm done in Paris!"
