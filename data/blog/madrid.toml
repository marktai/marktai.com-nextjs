    "My next stop in Europe was Madrid. This time I was staying in an Airbnb room with the host, which conveniently allowed me to share the host's, Weston, in unit washer, clothesline, and most importantly, shaving cream. Since my electric razor broke down, figuring out how to keep my mustache managed was a new problem I needed to solve at every destination. ",

    "The room in Madrid might be the one best suited for me yet. Weston explained to me that Spain's practice of siestas led to ensuring highly effective blackout solutions, which in my case was just closed doors. My first morning I slept into 12 pm, awaking a couple of times but assuming it was still the middle of the night! ",

    "As for why I was staying up late, I've been shifting back into more non-touristy experiences including simply drinking with some new friends, playing chess late into the night, or binging Made in Abyss. Since I'm no longer staying in hostels, my source of social interactions has been Airbnb experiences, though I randomly met Billy and Matt at the last bar my tapas tour ended up at. One quote from Billy that I wholeheartedly agree with is \"proving adults can make friends as easily as children.\" I've been able to just chat up people and end up at a bar or two later that night with them. However, I'm realizing more and more that I'm more of an introvert than an extrovert, and I'm perfectly enjoy to spend a day mostly by myself and exploring food.",

    "Speaking of food, some 14 years ago, I went on a trip to Barcelona with my family, and we were surprised and disappointed at the size and price of tapas. Now with a more mature food palette and appetite for price, I had a great time eating all over Madrid. My favorite food of Madrid was Cocido Madrileno, a primarily chickpea stew served in multiple courses. Unfortunately as a solo traveler, I didn't get a chance to try paella, but there's always next time!",
		
		"After Madrid, I'll be staying in Bologna, which I chose as the less dense destination of this Europe trip. I'm excited to try out the Italian pastas with my friends have spoke so highly of!"
